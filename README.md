Weather-App is a third-party API powered weather forecast application that provides the user information about local real-time weather, humidity, wind speed and UV index and five-day weather forecasts. By a user selecting a city, the application accesses the OpenWeatherMap API, retrieves local weather data and stores the last five cities searched for later review. 

I designed this application to demonstrate my JQuery proficiency, as well as mastery over the utilization of Bootstrap styling features, including the use of nested rows and columns and cards and demonstrate proficiency of third-party API usage, as this application required the use of three separate calls to the OpenWeatherMap API.

Key Features:

API call to OpenWeatherMap providing the current weather conditions in a given city, including:

Current temparature
Current humidity
Current wind speed
Current UV Index, indicating wether the city index is low, moderate, or high (Note: The UV Index information required a separate API call)
Icon illustrating the current weather

API call provides 5-day forecast using a separate API call showing the:

Forecasted temparature
Forecasted humidity, and 
Forecasted weather icon

Local storage functionality allowing the user to enter and retrieve up to five cities at any time, to track the conditions in multiple locations for later reference.
